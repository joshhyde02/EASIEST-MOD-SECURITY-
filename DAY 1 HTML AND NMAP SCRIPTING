PENETRATION TESTING    
        -- PHASE 1 - MISSION DEFINITION
                  -- define mission goals and targets
                  - detemrine scope of mission 
                  - define roe
       -- PHASE 2 - RECON
                  - infomration gathering about the target through public sources (OSINT) 
       -- PHASE 3 - FOOTPRINTING

                  - additional functionality to fulfill requirements 
                  - communication security 
           -- TESTING
                  - exploit development occurs from pairing and mission requirement 
                        - tested and verified for success
                  - testing provides a number of benefits
                        - faster time to breakout of ininital foothold
                        - reduce risk of detection and tool failure
                        - improved recovery times
           -- PLAN
                  - procure hardware and software
                  - assign developer
                  - assign a test to develop TTPs and break it
                  - document testing results
                  - testing environment

HOST DISCOVERY
      - PING SWEEPS
            - LINUX - for i in {1..254} ;do (ping -c 1 192.168.1.$i | grep "bytes from" &) ;done
            - WINDOWS - for /L %i in (1,1,255) do @ping -n 1 -w 200 192.168.1.%i > nul && echo 192.168.1.%i is up.
      - HOST ENUMERATION (OPEN PORTS)
            - nmap -sS -Pn 8.8.8.8 -p 135-139,22,80,443,21,8080
                  - nmap requires the "-Pn" to be run through proxychains
                  - nmap -Pn -T5 192.168.65.10 --script=banner.nse -p 22,3389, runs banner script to find what services are running on specific ports, in case where -sV failed
            - nc -z -v -w 1 8.8.8.8 440-443 
                  - nc does not ping an ip address before enumerating ports, therefore itss cracked over proxychains
      - HOST INTERROGATION
            - use nc to interrogate a server
                  - nc -Cv 127.0.0.1 80
                  - Type: GET / HTTP/1.0 - to get a HTTP response header from the server
            - use nmap to perform service detection on port 22 of your opstation
                  - nmap -sV 127.0.0.1 -p 22
            - using nikto to perform a vulnerability scan on your opstation 
                  - nikto -h 127.0.0.1 -p 80

SHAVING WHATEVER THE FUCKITS CALLED
           - http://localhost:7777/
bruh
to pull smb bullshit
proxychains nmap -Pn 192.168.150.245 --script smb-os-discovery.nse -p 139,445
do not forget to run nmap scripts against open ports
